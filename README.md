# SceneCreator

A project to create a high-quality virtual scenery and take high-resolution images of it via raycasting. The project is somewhat inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/RayTracing/InOneWeekend) and [my other project](https://github.com/marc131183/GymRubiksCube) that is concerned with image rendering.

Since this is my first major c++ project and one that I did to get more familiar with the language, one should not expect exceptional code quality.

It is tested with g++ 9.4.0 on Ubuntu 20.04.

## Currently Implemented Features

- Basic ray-casting + virtual objects
- Parallelization of ray-casting procedure (CPU)
- Textures for objects
- Rotation of objects
- Lighting

## Planned Features

- Different types of materials for objects to support reflectiveness etc.
